<div>
	A space separated list of scope. A scope follows the usual rules for
	package names (url-safe characters, no leading dots or underscores).<br>
	<p>
		In package names is preceded by an @-symbol and followed by a slash,
		e.g. <b>@somescope/somepackagename</b>. Scopes are a way of grouping
		related packages together, and also affect a few things about the way
		npm treats the package.
