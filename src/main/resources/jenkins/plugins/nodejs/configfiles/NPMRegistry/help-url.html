	To resolve packages by name and version, npm talks to a registry
	website that implements the CommonJS Package Registry specification for
	reading package info.
	<p>
		The registry URL used is determined by the scope of the package (see <a
			href="https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scope">npm-scope</a>). If no scope
		is specified, the default registry is used, which is supplied by the
		registry config parameter
	</p>
